this is only *two days* worth of typescript.  This is not a product.  
+++++ I do not publish code without tests; this is not published +++++

I am showing:
* I can use Enum (feels weird outside of SQL)
* I can use interfaces and types
* I can use basic React 
* I have made a reason to have a generic type (not been in a situation where those would help previously)

I have not built:
* or imported any CSS
* any tests; but code does compile to JS
* the server API
* support for older browsers yet; for a product I would transpile to a more generic version of JS
